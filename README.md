# The-Magnificent-Seven

In the stock market, quantitative analysis is a financial approach that makes use of statistical and mathematical methods to examine equities and financial markets. In this project, we will do a quantitative analysis of the so-called "magnificent seven." The name "Magnificent Seven" was derived from the title of a 1960 Western film directed by John Sturges, which starred a group of seven gunmen. But now, when we are talking about the magnificent seven, we mean the group of high-performing and influential companies in the U.S. stock market. The term was first used in 2023 by Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett in reference to the following seven companies: Alphabet (GOOG),Amazon (AMZN),Apple (AAPL),Meta Platforms (META),Microsoft (MSFT),NVIDIA (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA). These companies are well-known for their market dominance, technological influence, and changes in consumer behavior and economic trends. So, why do a quantitative analysis of these stocks? A short answer is that these businesses have the potential to grow significantly and are the leaders of industries including digital services, cloud computing, electric cars, and artificial intelligence. But we must also bear in mind that these factors have already been priced in, so investing in them still carries risks.
